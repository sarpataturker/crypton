# CRYPTON - Ultimate Multi-Algorithm Requirements
# ==============================================
# ALL packages below are REQUIRED and ACTIVE for full 43 algorithm support

# ===== CORE CRYPTOGRAPHIC LIBRARIES (REQUIRED) =====
cryptography>=41.0.0
bcrypt>=4.0.0
argon2-cffi>=23.0.0
pynacl>=1.5.0
passlib>=1.7.4

# ===== USER INTERFACE (REQUIRED) =====
colorama>=0.4.6

# ===== ALGORITHM BREAKDOWN =====
# cryptography: Fernet, AES variants, ChaCha20, RSA, ECDH, Ed25519, X25519, DSA, hashes
# bcrypt: bcrypt password hashing
# argon2-cffi: Argon2id, Argon2i, Argon2d
# pynacl: Salsa20, XChaCha20, NaCl primitives  
# passlib: SHA-512 crypt, additional password methods
# colorama: Cross-platform terminal colors
# Built-in Python: hashlib, base64, binascii, string (for classical ciphers)

# ===== DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES (OPTIONAL FOR DEVELOPERS) =====
# These are ONLY for people who want to MODIFY/IMPROVE the CRYPTON code
# Normal users DON'T need these - they're for:
#
# pytest>=7.0.0           # 🧪 TESTING: Run automated tests to verify code works
# black>=23.0.0           # 🎨 FORMATTING: Auto-format code to look clean  
# flake8>=6.0.0           # 🔍 LINTING: Check code quality and find bugs
# mypy>=1.0.0             # 📝 TYPE CHECKING: Verify data types are correct
# coverage>=7.0.0         # 📊 TEST COVERAGE: See how much code is tested
# pre-commit>=3.0.0       # 🚀 GIT HOOKS: Auto-run checks before commits
#
# TO USE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:
# 1. Uncomment the lines above (remove #)
# 2. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. Now you can contribute code improvements to CRYPTON!

# ===== FOR NORMAL USERS =====
# Just run: python main.py
# The 6 packages above will auto-install and you'll have all 43 algorithms!
# You DON'T need the development tools unless you want to modify CRYPTON's code.
